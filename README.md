this repository's history demonstrates the evolution of a client-side JavaScript
widget from a somewhat naive implementation into a more elegant, reusable and
framework-agnostic module

while it's useful that JavaScript allows highly procedural code, as this
encourages and simplifies experimentation, that style often significantly
hampers maintainability - so this is an attempt to illustrate the path from the
former to the latter

the implementation is not intended to be perfect, but merely to highlight
significant structural aspects for education purposes
